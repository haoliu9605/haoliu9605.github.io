<dt>Low-resource language and speech processing</dt>
<dd>The most effective language and speech processing systems are based on
statistical models learned from many annotated examples, a classic
application of machine learning on input/ output pairs. But for many
languages and domains we have little data. Even in cases where we do have
data, it is government or news text. For the vast majority of languages and
domains, there is hardly anything. However, in many cases, there is side
information that we can exploit: dictionaries or other knowledge sources,
or multimodal data such as text paired with images, speech, or timestamps.
How can we exploit such heterogeneous information in statistical language
processing? How can we exploit linguistic knowledge in our statistical
models? If we have little to no output examples, can we treat the
development of NLP systems as a decipherment problem? The goal of projects
in this area is to develop statistical models and inference techniques that
exploit such data, and apply them to real problems.</dd>
